React To-Do List App

This is a simple React project designed to showcase my skills in building efficient and user-friendly applications using React and Material-UI (MUI).
It features full CRUD operations with pop-up modals for task management, a progress bar to track completed tasks, and the ability to export todos as a JSON file.
All data is stored in local storage for persistent access across sessions.
